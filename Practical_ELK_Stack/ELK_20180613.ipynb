    "Almost all kinds of computing devices, systems, and applications emit some kind of log to indicate the state of the system. Put simply, a log is just a stream of messages in a time sequence. They may be directed to files and stored on a disk or directed to a log collector. Raw logs are just data, but when they are processed and analyzed, they provide useful information. Log analyzers take as input the mass of data produced by our firewalls, routres, IDS, and applications, and turn that data into actionable intelligence. "

    "Whenever a developer or system admin faces an issue with the system, the first instinct is to look at the logs. For a long time, we have relied on basic tools like grep,awk, or perl to perform log analysis. However, with changing times and cloud-scale applications, the earlier techniques no longer suffice. Imagine a system with tens, hundreds, or thousands of hosts. There are multiple instances of different applications running on all these hosts. To make things more interesting, these hosts may not be located at the same location, and we may have to deal with millions of lines in logs. In such a world, it is not possible to troubleshoot problems by using earlier-used tools or just looking at one particular host. Add to this the fact that the logs may be generated in different time zones, formats, and even in different languages. What is required a holistic log generation, parsing, storage, and analysis solution."
