    "Elasticsearch is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable, full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. It is a non.relational database (often stated as NoSQL), focusing on the storage of documents instead of records. These documents can be many formats, one of which is useful to us: JSON. This makes using Elacticsearch very simple as we do not need to convert our data to/from JSON. We will use Elastichsearch much more later in this chapter"

To store the content locally and do it correctly, we need to know that the type of media is, and it;s not enough to trust the file extension in the URL. We will learn how to download and correctly represent the media type based on information from the web server."

    "Finally, it is often the need to be able to transcode media, such as converting non-MP4 videos to MP4, or changing the bit-rate or resolution of a video. Another scenario is to extract only the audio from a video file. We won't look at video transcoding, but we will rip MP3 audio out of an MP4 file using ffmpeg. It's simple step from there to also transcode video with ffmpeg."
