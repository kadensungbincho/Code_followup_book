    "This chapter begins our tour of the Python language. In an informal sense, in Python we do things with stuff. \"Things\" take the form of operations like addition and concatenation, and \"stuff\" refers to the objects on which we perform those operations. In this part of the book, our focus is on that stuff, and the things our programs can do with it. \n",
    " Somewhat more formally, in Python, data takes the form of objects- either built-in objects that Python provides, or objects we create using Python classes or externa languase tools such as C extension libraries. Although we'll furm up this definition later, objects are essentially just pieces of memory, with values and sets of associated operations. As we'll see, everything is an object in a Python script. Even simple numbers qualify, with values, and supported operations."

    "To some readers, though, the object types in Table 4-1 may be more general and powerful than what you are accustomed to. For instance, you'll find that lists and dictionaries alone are powerful data representation tools that obviate most of the work you do to support collections and searching in lower-level languages. In short, lists provide ordered collections of other objects, while dictionaries store objects by key; both lists and dictionaries may be nested, can grow and shrink on demand, and may contain objects of any type."

    "you are, technically speaking, running a literal expression that generates and returns a new string object. There is specific Python language syntax to make this object. Similarly, an expression wrapped in square brackets makes a list, one in curly braces makes a dictionary, and so on. Even though, as we'll see, there are no type declarations in Python, the syntax of the expressions you run determinse the types of objects you create and use. In fact, object-generation expressions like those in Table 4-1 are generally where types originate in the Python language."
