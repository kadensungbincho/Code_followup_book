When he awoke, he realized that a molecular structure based on a similar ring shape would account for the properties of benzene. Further expeirmentation confirmed the hypothesis"

    " Consider the example of a heavy stone swinging back and forth on a string. Before Galilo, and Aristotelian looking at the swinging stone thought that a heavy object move naturally from a higher position to a state of rest at a lower one. The Aristotelian would think that what the stone was really doing was falling with difficulty. When Galile saw the swinging stone, he saw a pendulum. He thought that what the stone was really doing was repeating the same motion again and again, almost perfectly. "

Consequently, it has a profusion of complementary and coflicting metahpors. Some are better than others. Some are worse.
