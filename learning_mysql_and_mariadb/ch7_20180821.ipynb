In this chapter, we will cover it in greate detail. It's not necessary to know or use all of the many options, but some techniques such as joining tables together are basic to using relational atabases."

Entering data on your own was good for training purposes, but we now need much more data in our databases to better appreciate the examples in this chapter. If you haven't done so already, go to this book's website and download the dump files that contain tables of data."

For instance, in the first generic example, the UPDATE clause has a WHERE clause that expects a single value from the subquery. If the subquery returns several values, a row of columns, or a table of results, it will confuse MySQL and cause an error. So you need to be sure that the subquery you construct will return the type of values required by the outer query as you constructed it."
