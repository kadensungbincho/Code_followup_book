    "- For objext-oriented programming, the design step is perhaps the most important phase in the processof developing software. For it is in the design step that we decide how to divide the working of our porgram into classes, we decide how these classes will interact, what data each will store, and what actions each will perform. Indeed, one of the main challenges that beginning programmers face is decising what classes to define to do the work of their program. While general prescriptions are hard to come by, there are some rules of thumb that we can apply when determining how to desing our classes :"

    "- As the final example for this section, we develop our own implementation of a class that mimics Python's built-in range class. Before introducing our class, we discuss the history of the built-in version. Prior to Python 3 being released, range was implemented as a function, and it returned a list instance with elements in the specified range. For example, range(2, 10, 2) returned the list [2, 4, 6, 8]. However, a typical use of the function was to support a for-loop syntax, such as for k in range(10000000). Unfortunately, this caused the instantatiation and initialization of a list with the range of numbers. That was an unnecessary expensive step, in terms of both time and memory usage."

Rather than creating a new list instance, range is a class that can effectively represent the desired range of elements without ever sotring them explicitly in memory. To better explore the built-in range class, we recommend that you create an instance as r=range(8, 140, 5). The result is a relatively lightwight object, an instance of the range class, that has only a few behaviors. The syntax len(r) will report the number of elements that are in the given range(27, in our example). A range also supports the \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_ method, so that syntax r[]15 reports the sixteenth element in the range. Because the class supports both \\_\\_len\\_\\_ and \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_, it inherits automatic support for iteration, which is why it is possible to execute a for loop over a range."

To use the streamlined representation for all instances of a  class, that class definition must provide a class-level member named \\_\\_slots\\_\\_ that is assigned to a fixed sequence of strings that serve as names for instance variables.

This is in contrast to some languages that use static dispatching, making a compile-time decision as to which version of a function to call, based upon the declared type of a variable."
