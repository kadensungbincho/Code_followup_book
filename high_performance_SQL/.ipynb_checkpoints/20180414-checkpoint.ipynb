For instances, we might use MyISAM when its limited scalability, poor support for concurrency, and lack of crash resilience aren't an issue, but InnoDB's increased space consumtion is a problem."

They also tend to update counters and copile usage statistics about the various discussions. Many of the systems also use a few monolithic tables to store all their data.
