        - Use the == operator to check if the argument is a reference to this object
        - Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the correct type
        - Cast the argument to the correct type
        - For each 'significant' field in the class, check if that field of the argument matches the
            corresponding field of this object.

        - For best performance, you should first compare fields that are more likely to differ, less
            expensive to compare, or, ideally both.

        - When you are finished writing your equals method, ask yourself three questions:
            is it symmetric?
            is it transitive?
            is it consistent?
