    "- The answer to these questions comes from another trehnd in disk drives: seek time is improving more slowly than transfer rate. Seeking is the process of moving the disk's head to a particular place on the disk to read or writeddata. It characterizes the latency of a disk operation, whereas the transfer rate corresponds to a disk's bandwidth."

    "If the data access pattern is dominated by seeks, it will take longer to read or write large portions of the dataset than streaming through it, which operates at the transfer rate. On the otehr hand, for updating a small proportion of records in a database, a tranditional B-Tree works well. For updating the majority of a database, a B-Tree is less efficient than MapReduct, which uses Sort/Merge to rebuild the databse."

    "In many ways, MapReduce can be seen as a complement to a Relational Database Management System. MapReduce is a good fit for problems that need to analyze the whole dataset in a batch fashion, particularly for ad hoc analysis. An RDBMS is good for point queries or updates, where the dataset has been indexed to deliver low-latency retrieval and update times of a relatively small amount of data. MapReduce suits applications where the data is written once and read many times, whereas a relational database is good for database that are continually updated."

Relational databases have started incorporating some of the ideas from Hadoop, and from the other direction, Hadoop systems such as Hive are becoming more interactive and adding features like indexes and transactions that make them look more like traditional RDBMS"
